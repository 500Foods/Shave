# Shave

This is the very start of a Bash-to-C transpiler. Why? Well, lots of bash scripts in the world could do with a bit of a boost, and nearly everythign that a bash script is doing is often based on underlying C apps. So having something that converts a Bash script into its native C environment would likely be a huge improvement performance-wise, and also introduces opportunities for obfuscation and other security aspects that can't be achieved easily through Bash alone.
