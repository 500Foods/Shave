# Release Notes - July 5, 2025

## Version 0.1.0

### Overview

This is the inaugural release of Shave, a Bash-to-C transpiler designed to convert Bash scripts into native C executables for improved performance and potential security through obfuscation.

### Features

- **Initial Framework**: Complete setup of the Shave Bash-to-C transpiler with a modular architecture
- **Command-line Interface**: Robust argument parsing with support for input file, custom output name (-o/--output), help (-h/--help), and source retention (-k/--keep)
- **Code Generation**: Basic C code generation with boilerplate structure and placeholder for Bash-to-C conversion logic
- **Compilation**: Integration with GCC for compiling generated C code to native executables
- **User Feedback**: Detailed console output with color-coded status messages, timing information, and step tracking

### Technical Details

Shave v0.1.0 establishes a solid foundation for Bash-to-C transpilation. The project is structured into modular Bash scripts, each handling a specific aspect of the conversion process:

- `shave.sh`: Main entry point handling command-line arguments and orchestrating the transpilation process
- `shave-boilerplate.sh`: Generates the basic C scaffolding for the output executable
- `shave-parser.sh`: Processes Bash input and converts it to C code (currently implements basic line-by-line conversion)
- `shave-compiler.sh`: Manages compilation of generated C code using GCC with C17 standard
- `shave-output.sh`: Provides formatted, color-coded console output with timing and step information for user feedback
- `shave-hash.sh`: Implements a hashing utility using FNV-1a algorithm for generating unique identifiers for source files, variables, and functions (shave/shave-hash.sh)

The current implementation focuses on establishing the pipeline from Bash input to C executable output. While the Bash-to-C parsing is rudimentary (converting lines to printf statements), it sets the stage for sophisticated translation in future releases.

### Requirements

- GCC (GNU Compiler Collection) for compiling generated C code
- Bash shell environment
- Unix-like operating system (Linux or macOS)

### Files Added

- **Core Scripts**: `shave/shave.sh`, `shave/shave-boilerplate.sh`, `shave/shave-compiler.sh`, `shave/shave-parser.sh`, `shave/shave-output.sh`, `shave/shave-hash.sh`
- **Executable**: `shave/shave` (compiled binary)
- **Documentation**: `README.md` (updated to describe Shave Bash-to-C transpiler), `RELEASES.md`, `REQUIREMENTS.md`
- **Project Files**: `.gitattributes`, `.gitignore`, `LICENSE`

### Documentation Updates

- **REQUIREMENTS.md**: Updated to include comprehensive details on all required tools (Bash, GCC, Unix-like OS, UPX, NodeJS, tree-sitter), installation instructions for Fedora, Ubuntu, and macOS, and a detailed guide on building a C version of Shave itself, including cloning the repository, transpiling, verifying, and installing the executable globally in `/usr/local/bin`.
- **SITEMAP.md**: Added to the root directory as a directory of all Markdown files in the project, providing links to key documentation for easy navigation.
- **Tests README.md**: Added to the tests folder, offering a high-level overview of how to run tests and detailing the available test suites for the Shave project.

### Future Direction

This initial release focuses on establishing the toolchain and basic workflow. Future updates will enhance the Bash-to-C conversion with proper syntax translation, variable handling, control structures, and optimization of the generated C code for performance.
