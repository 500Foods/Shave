# Requirements

The Shave project requires the following tools and environment to function properly:

- **GCC (GNU Compiler Collection)**: Necessary for compiling the generated C executables from Bash scripts.
- **Bash**: The Shave transpiler is written in Bash and requires a Unix-like shell environment to run.
- **Unix-like Operating System**: Such as Linux or macOS, to ensure compatibility with Bash scripting and system commands.

Ensure these components are installed and properly configured on your system before using Shave.
